# Seasons App Summary

- This is a Season Display App

  - based on month and hemisphere
  - uses JS Date API, and `window.navigator.geolocation()` function to determine current season, `summer` or `winter`

- The goal of this app is to study the way `props`,`components` and the `componentDidMount` life-cycle method work together

  - Class based Component is used to
    - understand how state is managed in a class based component
    - how a `constructor` can be used to initialize state
      - and without the `constructor`
  - Semantic UI and custom CSS is used for styling the app based on the determined season

# Geolocation

- Can be faked with `Developer Tools > Sensors Tool > Location`
  - check for both Northern and Southern Hemishpere

# MRWR Class Work
